## 💼 Work Experience

### Lead Frontend Engineer | Sbayt

November 2023 – Present | Remote (A Coruña, ES)

Technical leadership of the frontend for an industrial data analytics platform (steel rolling mills) designed for plant operators and business-side users.

* **Product Development:** Built from scratch a **Next.js**-based web platform connected to Big Data systems (Spark, Kafka, MinIO) for failure prediction (and medium-term self-correction, based on intelligent systems and big data).
* **Architecture & Performance:** Implemented mission-critical real-time observability dashboards for the plant, prioritizing stability and performance via **React Query** and SSR/caching optimizations, with UI designed ad hoc for this workflow: instant bursts of subtle animations on each dashboard datum when it updates, to guide attention progressively without overwhelming.
* **Design Systems:** Designed in Figma and implemented an extensive custom design system (inspired by Shopify Polaris, built on shadcn/ui) using **Radix UI** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring visual consistency and component reuse across the company. This spans buttons, inputs and forms through to complex data tables with backend-driven sorting, filtering via criteria pattern and pagination, in a type-safe, testable, extendable way with excellent UX where progressive disclosure yields an extremely powerful, expressive UI without being overwhelming, technically underpinned by TanStack Query + Table.
* **UX Engineering:** Developed advanced micro-interactions and "physical" animations (replicating analog indicators) with **Framer Motion** and CSS, as a design nod to the physical control panels that used to exist in manufacturing plants, which this product aims to replace.
* **DevOps & Quality:** Defined CI/CD pipelines on **AWS** (GitHub Actions), testing strategies and long-term technical roadmap for the frontend.

### Fullstack Engineer | Gradiant

February 2022 – October 2023 | Hybrid (Vigo, ES)

Versatile role in the security division, spanning cryptography to mobile development.

* **Backend & Algorithms:** Implemented efficient data anonymization algorithms in **Python** (NumPy, Pandas).
* **Mobile Development:** Designed and developed a design system for an Android sovereign identity (SSI) app, implementing prototypes and production code in **Kotlin**.
* **Frontend Security:** Built and optimized security SPAs using **React** and **Vue** (Redux, Vuex, Webpack).
* **Mentoring:** Mentored interns on frontend best practices, raising the team's code quality.

### Frontend Developer (Intern) | Gradiant

June 2021 – August 2021 | Hybrid (Vigo, ES)

* Designed and developed the frontend for a data anonymization service (European Project Infinitech).
* Built a **Vue** and **TypeScript** SPA, significantly improving UX over the previous command-line solution.
