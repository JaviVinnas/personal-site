# My Personal Website

This is my personal corner on the web, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## 🚀 Current Status

Currently, this site primarily serves as my **online resume**. Here you can find information about my professional experience, skills, and projects I've worked on.

## 🧞 Future of the Project

This isn't just a static resume. My future plans include turning it into:

- **Technical Blog**: A space where I'll share what I'm learning, tutorials, and reflections on software development.
- **Experiment Lab**: A place to test new technologies, libraries, and whatever I feel like building with Astro.
- **Extended Portfolio**: A more detailed showcase of my experiments and open-source contributions.

All commands are run from the root of the project, in a terminal:
